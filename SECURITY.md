# Security Policy

## Safe Build Criteria

At Overmounting, we prioritize the security of our codebase. Here's our policy for considering a build as "safe":

1. **Code Review:**
   - Every code change undergoes a thorough review by our development team.

2. **Automated Testing:**
   - All builds must pass automated security tests, including static analysis and vulnerability scanning.

3. **Dependency Scanning:**
   - We regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities, and a build is considered safe only if all dependencies are up-to-date and free from critical vulnerabilities.

4. **Security Review:**
   - A dedicated security review is conducted for significant changes or features.

5. **Secure Configuration:**
   - Our deployment configurations follow security best practices.

6. **Incident Response:**
   - We have a well-defined incident response plan in case security issues are identified post-release.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover any security concerns or vulnerabilities in our codebase, please follow our [Reporting a Vulnerability](#reporting-a-vulnerability) guidelines.

Thank you for your commitment to the security of Overmounting.
